\section*{Abstract}

In this project, I investigate ways to improve the accuracy of text readability
predictions on a CEFR level using BERT language models. This is done with both
a standard BERT model trained on whole texts and a model trained using
a windowing technique that is also applied during prediction.

The motivation behind improving accuracy for readability prediction is grounded
in the Zeeguu platform. Zeeguu recommends articles to users based on preference
and readability. By improving the accuracy of the readability measure, the user
experience will be directly improved through more fitting recommendations.

Zeeguu uses the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formula as the estimator of readability, so that is the baseline to which I am
comparing the models. Even using a standard BERT model yields a
significantly higher performance than FRE. However, using the windowing technique in combination
with a BERT model yields even better results.

Finding CEFR labeled datasets for use in model training and evaluation proved
to be a difficult task. The training dataset used is not directly labeled with
CEFR levels but with difficulty levels that correspond to CEFR levels.
Additionally, it lacks any texts at the C2 level. To evaluate the models, I
manually collected an evaluation corpus. The corpus consists of texts from
English learner books at each CEFR level.

\section{Introduction}

An increasing number of people are learning a second language on their own
using a platform such as Duolingo, which has over 500 million users
\parencite{duolingo2022Duolingo}. Platforms like Duolingo offer a more
personalized approach to language learning than the traditional classroom
experience. This is also the motive behind the Zeeguu platform. Rather than a
standardized text book that is one-size-fits-all for language learners,
Zeeguu acts as a "personalized textbook" that uses content from the web as its
source \parencite{10.1145/3173574.3173912}. The Zeeguu platform recommends
articles based on user preference and readability of the article. For the system to
work well, the readability of the article must be accurate, or a user will end up
with articles that are either too easy or too difficult for them.
The motivation behind this project is to develop a method for estimating article
readability that is better than the method currently used in Zeeguu. This will
improve the user experience by making the recommended articles more suited for
the individual user.

The current method used in Zeeguu is Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), which uses
a formula with average sentence length and average syllables per word to
estimate the readability of a text. The result from the FRE formula is then
converted into the CEFR level which is displayed on the website. Surface-level features such as words per
sentence or average syllables per word used in the FRE formula have been shown
to be poor estimators of readability \parencite{pitler-nenkova-2008-revisiting}.
Better estimators of readability are deeper syntactic, semantic, and discourse
features. Through a more advanced approach using a BERT language model, the
hope is that it will use more of these deeper language features with greater
correlation with readability.

\noindent
Therefore, the research question that will be the focus of this paper is the
following:

\begin{displayquote}
  How accurately can we predict the readability of articles on a CEFR level
  through the use of a BERT language model?
\end{displayquote}

\noindent
To answer this question, I train a BERT model on a large dataset of student-
submitted texts with difficulty levels that correspond to CEFR. Additionally, I
train another BERT model using a windowing technique to eliminate some of the
influence of sentence length and whole text length on the model. To evaluate
the models, I collect a small evaluation dataset of text from English learner
books at each CEFR level.

\section{Related Work}

Traditionally, readability in texts is usually measured using a formula that
considers certain features of the text. This is commonly features such as
average sentence length and average number of syllables per word in the text.
One of the most commonly used measures of readability of English texts is the
Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), which is based on those two features. It was developed by
Rudolf Flesch in the 1940s and is still widely used today and is used as the US
government standard. Another widely used metric of readability is the Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level. This was
developed by J. Peter Kincaid in 1975 and is a development on the Flesch
reading ease intended to make it easier to use \parencite{Kincaid1975DerivationON}. The Flesch reading ease
produces a number from 0-100. Various ranges of the score can be interpreted as
corresponding to certain US grade levels. Instead, the Flesch-Kincaid reading
grade level formula produces a score that directly corresponds to a US grade
level.

About 20 years ago, research of automatic classification of readability levels
started. One of the big downsides of the classical readability
formulas is that they require certain assumptions for the text to be made.
One of these is that the text must contain at least 100 words or 10
sentences and that it uses well-defined sentences such that sentence length
can be properly measured. Particularly the limitation on sentence length led to
two of the first studies into automatic classification of readability.
\parencite{collins-thompson-callan-2004-language}
used a multinomial na√Øve Bayes model that combines multiple language models to
estimate the most likely grade level for any given passage.
\parencite{10.1145/1008992.1009114} used support vector machine learning algorithms
based on both syntactic and semantic features and treated the readability
estimation as a text classification problem.

Automatic classification of readability has some benefits over the traditional
formulas typically used for readability estimation. The main benefit that was the
motivation behind the studies mentioned was accuracy on shorter texts. Additionally,
the use of trained classifiers meant that it was possible to train
or retrain models for specific purposes.
\parencite{collins-thompson-callan-2004-language} showed that they obtained good
performance for both English and French, only requiring a change in morphology
handling during feature processing. Another study used an SVM with surface-level
features such as sentence length and vocabulary to compare articles and sort them
in terms of difficulty \parencite{10.1162/coli.09-036-R2-08-050}. By comparing the
difficulty of articles rather than classifying the specific difficulty of each article, they
lowered the requirements for training data by requiring only two levels of difficulty to be
annotated. In an application like Zeeguu this alternative approach could also work. The specific
difficulty of an article does not matter much as long as it is possible to retrieve other articles of
similar difficulty for recommendations.

As research into automatic classification of readability became more common, an important task
was to figure out which features correlated best with readability. A study combined lexical, syntactic and discourse
features to produce a predictive model of human readers' judgments of text readability \parencite{pitler-nenkova-2008-revisiting}.
They showed that surface-level features such as sentence length or average number of syllables are not very good predictors
of text readability, despite generally being expected to be. They found that readability predictors
behave differently depending on the task. Predicting text readability and ranking the readability of texts
cause predictors to behave differently. Discourse relations were found to be the best predictor across both tasks.

A recent study \parencite{kerz-etal-2021-automated} also looked at using automatic classification of readability, specifically on the CEFR scale.
They used RNNs combined with a sliding window technique to predict CEFR levels. They used a sliding window
with a size of one sentence to create what they refer to as 'complexity contours.' Each sentence
had their complexity evaluated using 57 different features. The windows were then fed into an RNN that could
capture the sequential information of the windows. The study also found through a secondary experiment that the
features that contributed most to classification accuracy were frequency n-gram measures. 12 of the top 20 features
were uni-, bi- or trigram frequency measures.

\section{Data}

\subsection{Training Dataset}

The training data came from the Education First Cambridge Open Language
Database (EFCAMDAT) \parencite{inbook}. The database
contains user-submitted texts from EF Education First, an international English
school teaching English as a second language. The database is compiled
in collaboration with Cambridge University \parencite{hgbka17}. The database
contains student assignment submission to Englishtown, which is the online
school of EF Education First. Students submit assignments that are graded and
corrected for errors by a teacher. The grade is included in the data, as are the
error corrections for a portion of the assignments. The curriculum of
Englishtown is divided into 16 levels covering all six CEFR levels from A1
to C2. The relation between the Englishtown levels and CEFR levels is shown in
\autoref{tab:englishtown-cefr}. The database release contains a subcorpus which contains the texts that
have error corrections supplied (√ñks√ºz et al., paper unavailable as it is under
review). The error corrections have been automatically applied to the texts to produce
corrected texts. The full database contains 1,180,309 submissions, and the
subcorpus contains 620,207 of these with automatically corrected texts. There
is a rather uneven distribution of CEFR labels in the subcorpus as can be seen
in \autoref{fig:efcamdat-distribution}. Additionally, no texts from the C2 level
are included in the subcorpus used for training the model. While a few are present in the
whole EFCAMDAT database, the subcorpus with the corrected texts does not contain any C2
level texts. Some examples of sentences from assignment texts can be seen in \autoref{tab:efcamdat-examples}.

\subsection{Validation Dataset}

To validate the performance of the trained model, I collected a
validation corpus. The corpus consists of texts from English teaching books at each CEFR level.
All books are from different book series by National Geographic Learning.
For an overview of the specific book title used for each CEFR level see
\autoref{tab:validation-books}. All the books had a pretty similar structure
consisting of exercises where the reader must fill in or pick the right
word(s), multiple choice questions, and reading comprehension questions. The
reading comprehension questions were all accompanied by a text of varying
length. Some were a couple sentences long, while others spanned multiple
paragraphs. Some examples of texts at different CEFR levels can be seen in
\autoref{tab:validation-examples}. I collected all of these texts from each book to use for the
validation corpus. To extract the texts from the books, I scanned the books and
performed OCR using \verb!pytesseract! to
extract the text. Then I manually went through and corrected each scanned text,
as the text was not always extracted correctly.

Each book is stated to be intended for a specific CEFR level of proficiency.
Therefore, I made the assumption that the texts from the reading comprehension exercises
should be at the same level of readability. The
result is a corpus with CEFR labeled texts that can be used to validate the
model. The distribution of labels in the resulting corpus is more even than in
the training data, with many more difficult texts, as can be seen in
\autoref{fig:validation-distribution}.

\section{Methodology}

I trained multiple models on the EFCAMDAT subcorpus. Some were trained using the
texts as they were, but I also trained a model using a windowing technique
similar to \parencite{kerz-etal-2021-automated}. In the following sections, I
describe the setup and methodology used in training and evaluating each
set of models.

\subsection{Dataset splitting}

For training the models without the windowing technique, the whole EFCAMDAT subcorpus was split
into train, evaluation, and test splits. This was done using random sampling.
The training split was given 80\% of the data, with the evaluation and test
splits each containing 10\% of the data. As illustrated in
\autoref{fig:dataset-splits-labels}, the result is that each split of data had
a nearly identical distribution of labels. I did not convert the Englishtown
levels into CEFR before training the models, so all models output the 1-16
Englishtown levels which can then be converted into CEFR.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/split-distributions-full-texts.png}
  \caption{CEFR label distribution in dataset splits}
  \label{fig:dataset-splits-labels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simple SVM models}

I trained some simple support vector machine (SVM) models on surface-level features in the
train split of the dataset. I used the features average sentence length and
term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). I trained three models, two
using each feature separately and one using both in combination. The models
were trained using \verb!sklearn!'s \verb!SGDClassifier! which trains an SVM
model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning. I used the default parameters for the model.
As part of preprocessing the features were standardized. In the model using only sentence
length, the data were standardized to unit mean and variance. In the two models
using TF-IDF the data were only standardized to unit variance, as the very
sparse nature of the TF-IDF feature matrix made it impossible to standardize
the mean.

\subsection{BERT model without windowing}

I also trained a BERT model on the train split of the dataset. The model was trained
using the \verb!Trainer! class from the \verb!transformers! package, and the
model used was the \verb!google-bert/bert-base-cased! model. The model was
trained using default parameters and with accuracy used for early stopping.
The evaluation split was used to compute the accuracy for early stopping.

\subsection{BERT model using windowing technique}

I also trained a BERT model using a windowing technique on the training
split. Instead of each piece of training data being a full text and the
corresponding label, the text was split into multiple data points by using a
sliding window. The window length corresponded to about 3 sentences. I computed
the median sentence length in the dataset to be approximately 12.5 words and
the average word length to be approximately 4 characters. By using a window
size of 150 characters, that was equivalent to 3 sentences based on those median
measurements. The sliding window started at the beginning of the text and
captured the next 150 characters. Then it moved to the beginning of the second
sentence and took the next 150 characters. Then it moved to the beginning of the
third sentence, and so on until there were no more sentences in the text. An
example of how this looked for a sample text is shown in
\autoref{tab:windowing-example}. The idea behind using the windowing technique
was to prevent the model from fitting to closely on just the length of the whole texts
as well as the sentence lengths.

The result was that there were a lot more training data after applying the
windowing to the dataset. To keep the training time within a realistic time frame, it was
necessary to thin out the dataset by sampling some of it. I tried to even out
the distribution of labels in the dataset somewhat by randomly sampling
a different proportion of the data points for each label. For A1 that was 10\%
of the data points, for A2 it was 20\%, for B1 it was 40\%, and for the
remaining labels, all data points were kept. The amount of C1 labels was too
low to completely even out the distribution without keeping too little
data. The distribution is shown in \autoref{fig:cefr-distribution-sampled}.

After downsampling the dataset, the windowing technique was applied to all the
texts. Each window was now its own training data sample. Each sample was given the
label from the text it came from. Then I trained a BERT model using the same method
and parameters as the one trained on whole texts from the whole dataset.

\begin{table}

  \begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{1cm}
  For an example text from the evaluation data, the full text and corresponding
  windows look like this:

  \begin{displayquote}

    many parts of the Colosseum are ruins but it is an important example of Roman
    architecture. It is very popular and many tourists visit it. You can see the

\end{figure}

\subsection{Using windowing technique in model predictions}

I also experimented with implementing the sliding window technique during prediction.
Instead of predicting on the whole text, I would use the sliding window in the same way
as during training. The text sample would be split into windows, each given the label
from the original text. Then I would have the model predict a label for
each window of the text and then aggregate the labels into a single label
for the whole text. I experimented with multiple ways of aggregating the
labels. The most straight-forward way would be to give the
text the label of the most frequently occurring label from the classifications
of the windows. However, the labels are the 1-16 Englishtown levels, which can
be considered a continuous scale. Due to this I also tried using the mean and
the median of the windows' classified labels to get a single label for the
whole text.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results for all models on the evaluation corpus}
  \label{tab:results}
\end{table}

I chose the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formula as the baseline to compare the model results to.
This was chosen because it was the current method
used to compute readability in the Zeeguu platform. As the motivation behind
this project was to attempt to improve the accuracy of the readability measure
of the Zeeguu platform, it seems sensible to choose that as a baseline. In
Zeeguu the FRE scores were mapped to CEFR labels by evenly dividing the FRE
scores that range from 0 to 100 into 6 bins, corresponding to the 6 CEFR
levels. Therefore, I compared against that binning. This FRE baseline performed with an
F1 score of 0.11 on the evaluation corpus. It is clear from
the confusion matrix in \autoref{fig:confusion-matrices} that the FRE
metric consistently underestimated the difficulty of the texts in the
evaluation corpus. In the context of usage in Zeeguu, it would be preferable to
overestimate the difficulty level of the articles instead. It would be better
to present the user with an article that is easier than intended
rather than one that turns out to be more difficult than they can handle.
The bin ranges that convert the FRE score into CEFR could presumably be optimized in
future work to achieve this better accuracy and a tendency to overestimate
rather than underestimate.

The standard BERT model trained and predicting on the whole
texts performed significantly better on the evaluation corpus than the FRE
formula. The model got an F1 score of 0.19. As can be seen in the confusion
matrix in \autoref{fig:confusion-matrices}, the model did better at
predicting the correct label and less often overestimated or
underestimated the readability.

I wanted to get a better idea of how well some of the surface-level features, like average sentence length
and vocabulary features, could be used as an estimator for
readability. To achieve this I trained simple three SVM models; one on average sentence
length, one on TF-IDF, and one trained on a combination of both. The model trained on
average sentence length performed with an F1 score of 0.14, while both
models using TF-IDF scored 0.18. It seemed like these features used in a
simple machine learning model was enough to reach a similar performance to the
BERT model. It is possible that the BERT model mostly took into consideration
some of the more surface-level features, like sentence length, vocabulary, and
text length. That could explain why it was possible to obtain a similar
performance using only some of those features as estimators for
readability.

In an attempt to alleviate this concern I trained the BERT model using the
windowing technique on the training data. Predicting on the whole text like
with the standard BERT model gave an F1 score of 0.22, which was already an
improvement. But by using the windowing technique during prediction too the
performance increased even more depending on the aggregation method. The worst
performing aggregation method was choosing the prediction with the highest
count among the windows as the prediction for the whole text. This method got
an F1 of 0.23. Using the median got an F1 score of 0.24.
Using the mean performed the best with an F1 score of 0.25. This
was a big improvement over the standard BERT model and an even bigger
improvement over the FRE formula. All the results mentioned are also presented
in \autoref{tab:results} for easier comparison.

Despite the mean yielding slightly better performance, taking the Zeeguu
context into account, the median might be better to use. Looking at the
confusion matrices for the predictions using the mean and median in
\autoref{fig:confusion-matrices}, it seems that when using the median to
get a single prediction for a text there was more of a tendency to overestimate
the readability a bit. As mentioned earlier, this is preferable to
underestimating the difficulty, which seemed to happen more when
using the mean.

Looking at \autoref{fig:level-per-window}, we can get an idea of how the
predictions for each window in a difficult text might look. If we look at the
first C1 text, it is a clear indication as to why simply choosing the most
common prediction among the windows is likely the worst option. Many of the
windows are predicted to be level 7, while a couple are predicted to be level 14
and 15 as well. But if the majority prediction is 7 the overall prediction for
the text will be wrong. Given a text like this the median could also give a
fairly wrong prediction if about half the windows are predicted much too low
and about half too high with no predictions falling in between. So in a case
like this the mean is likely the best option as it would even out the high and
low predictions and yield a fairly correct prediction. But in the other
examples where the predictions are more spread out across the scale, the median
should also perform well.

\section{Conclusion}

Using the windowing technique in combination with a BERT language model, it is
possible to largely improve the performance of classifying text readability
on a CEFR scale over the FRE formula used in Zeeguu. While a standard BERT
model also outperforms the FRE formula by a significant margin, a similar
performance can be obtained using a much simpler SVM model and surface-level
features such as sentence length and vocabulary. Using the windowing
technique during both training and prediction with a BERT model yields
significantly better results than the SVM models. Using the median to aggregate
the window-level predictions into a single prediction for the text seems to
offer the best trade-off between performance and leaning towards overestimating
readability rather than underestimating it.

One of the main limitations of this approach is the availability of suitable
training data. The full EFCAMDAT database has the problem of consisting of
texts with grammatical errors. The subcorpus that was used for training the
models relies on automatic error correction and has a very limited amount of
difficult texts, with no texts at the Englishtown level corresponding to C2 on
the CEFR scale. There is a lack of publicly available CEFR-labeled datasets,
especially of a size suitable for training a language model such as BERT.

Another limitation is the black-box nature of the BERT language model. It is
very difficult to find out what features in the text the language model is
primarily using for its predictions. An assumption was made that the model
likely latches particularly onto surface-level features such as sentence length and
total text length, but it is difficult to prove. The windowing technique tries to
fix that and let the model focus on deeper syntactic features, but it is once
again very difficult to prove whether that is actually the result.

There is also a limitation and room for improvement in the algorithm used for
the windowing of the data. The windowing is done using the most naive algorithm,
which is simply cutting the text after the 150 character window. This means the window
will almost certainly stop in the middle of a sentence and likely cut the last word short.
Stopping in the middle of a sentence could be either positive or negative. It likely does
something to limit sentence length as a very influential feature of the prediction. At the same
time, the language model does not get the whole context of the last sentence in the window,
which could also impact the accuracy of the prediction negatively. The last word being cut short
is also not ideal, as it will result in either a different word or an out of vocabulary word.
Future work building on this method might wish to optimize the windowing algorithm. It is possible
working with a window based on number of words or sentences might work better than number
of characters.

As mentioned before, it would be interesting to work on optimizing the bins
converting FRE score to CEFR labels. The optimal bin ranges likely depend on
the nature of the texts the formula is used on. Methods like
entropy-based binning or error-based binning would be good candidates to
achieve optimized bins for a specific task. I have shown that a
general-purpose language model like BERT is able to achieve significantly
better results than using just surface-level features. Even
more performance can likely be gained by using a model specifically designed for
the task at hand. The best estimators for readability are deeper
syntactic, semantic, and discourse features. Designing a specialized model that
is able to explicitly use these types of features would be an interesting
avenue for future work on this topic. It would also be interesting to try to use a more
sophisticated method to aggregate the classifications of each window into a single score.
For example, an RNN might be able to use some of the sequential information to produce
a more accurate score for each whole text.

  information. You can print it from your computer after you book your ticket.
  When you go to the airport, you can give the E-ticket and your passport to

  8 & Hi Mr. Smith, I'd like to inform you that I have recently had a meeting
  with our business partner, Sally Cassidy. She was very friendly and
  optimistic. We discussed our cooperative project for the next year. It seems
  like a very lucrative and meaningful one. It's imperative to wrap up our
  current manufacturing process, so that we will be able to start the new one.
  Sally Cassidy invited me to visit their office and speak about the schedule
  tomorrow morning. However, I will keep you informed. Best regards, Tatiana\\

  10 & I had a meeting last week, actually was an interview for a new job. I
  was attend to be a trader in a big company here in my city. After
  introductions, (there was me, the export manager and one sales analyst), the
  manager asked me to talk a little bit about my experiences on my last
  position, I started with my graduation and how I migrated from tech to
  commercial department, then I described my experience with business in other
  countries. Here, they did some questions about how was my behavior in some
  situations, we started to talk about some cultures and behavior in different
  countries and then the manager explained what they expected from a new
  employee. He asked me if I was comfortable with this position and I said yes,
  then we talked about salary and he asked me on week to analyse and return to
  me.\\
  \midrule
  12 & I consider table manners important and I'm trying to teach them to my
  sons. Everyday, while we are eating at home, I ensure that they do not leave
  the table without permission, mine or my husband's, or, they do not ask for
  water without saying 'please' and 'thank you'. In particular, I want them to
  eat with their mouths closed, use the fork instead of taking the food with
  their hands and I don't want them to shout while we are at the table. When we
  are invited at somebody else's house for dinner, they behave really well.
  They want to carry and give the present we normally take to the hostess
  themselves, ask for permission to enter the house and never touch things
  around without seeking permission. What I want my sons to understand is that
  following some simple rules make them get more appreciated by the people
  surrounding them. They gain respect, too. My elder son has already understood
  that through politeness you can also respect the others' personal spaces and
  sensibilities. In Italy, many parents consider the education of children as a
  DIY activity. Not theirs, but their children's.\\
  \midrule
  13 & Unfortunately, green business is not so popular in my city. Citizens do
  not understand how important it is to use biodegradable and organic
  materials. I know only a few entrepreneurs who truly try to run a business to
  manufacture green products. My friend has an on-line shop of string bags for
  various categories of people such as housewife, business men, teenagers and
  etc. The bags may be cleaned and we have an opportunity not to use disposable
  plastic bags. Several companies made their offices with two sources of
  electricity there are an usual generator and solar panels. Their bills have
  become quite less. The second distinctive feature of these companies is
  digital devices instead of regular paper. Of course, in this case costs have
  become more. However, the local radio station interviews employees from these
  companies once a week in the evening program and the local newspaper
  publishes articles with surveys about their work conditions. So, by that
  companies got free advertisements. It is a balancing act to decide whether
  sustainability is essential or not for your business. But we are not only
  consumer of the planet's resources, we are part of it too.\\
  \midrule
  15 & Last year I was on a vacation in California. It was wonderful but one
  thing stays in my mind. People in America tend to communicate more indirectly
  compared with people in Germany, where I'm living. If you talk with someone
  you don't know you don't know if he says the truth or just wants to be nice
  to you. Sometimes this is really strange. But this is a foreign country with
  a different culture than what we have in Germany. Nevertheless I prefer
  direct communication although it's vulnerable. The kind of body language is
  similar to the one in Germany. There are no big differences.\\

  B2 & It is now over 50 years since the first publication of E.P. Torrance‚Äôs Tests of Creative Thinking, and they continue to be used worldwide as standard assessments of creativity.
  The tests typically consist of ‚Äòdivergent thinking‚Äô tasks ‚Äì the ability to
  generate a wide variety of solutions that are then scored on fluency,
  flexibility, originality and how fully explained they are. For example:\newline
  - Ways to improve: What could you do to make a toy truck more fun to play
  with?\newline
  - Imagine consequences: How would the world be different if everyone had an eye
  in the back of their head?\newline
  - Alternative uses: How many unusual uses for a brick can you think of?
  - Make drawings from a shape: Turn the Xs into pictures people might be
  surprised by. The X can be in any part of the picture. Add details to tell
  complete stories and give each picture a title.\newline
  Some question if the tests fully assess creativity because they say creativity is about originality and usefulness. Creativity not only requires divergent thinking but also ‚Äòconvergent thinking‚Äô where you find one single solution that you feel is the best for the problem you are trying to solve.

% Torrance followed the lives of children who first took his tests to see if they predicted creative achievements as adults. Analyses of these studies suggest they do. In fact, his tests are better at judging future creative success than intelligence tests. This is why they are frequently used to identify top managers in business and children for special educational programmes. It is also why there was concern in the USA when the magazine Newsweek reported that children‚Äôs scores on the tests were falling.
% Some have argued that this drop is because of children‚Äôs lifestyles: too many video games, too much TV and too little freedom to make choices. Others have suggested that education in the USA has become too focused on exam results, so teachers use fewer creative activities and favour more traditional learning by heart. This is in contrast to countries with a history of more traditional activities like memorization and practice drills such as China, which are doing the opposite and encouraging creativity through techniques such as problem-based learning.
% Problem-based learning involves setting a genuine problem such as reducing
% noise in a school library or deciding on a week‚Äôs menu of meals for an athlete.
% In reaching a conclusion, students have to do research across several subjects
% and be creative in the fullest sense. No doubt Torrance would have approved if
% he was still alive.\\

  C1 & An African in Greenland \newline
  One morning, when my brothers had left early for the coconut plantation, and
  there was no-one left at home to take me for a walk along the seashore, I went
  out alone and visited the Evangelical Bookshop. Inside there were two shelves
  against the walls on either side of the counter. I went up to one of these,
  attracted by a book laid flat on a half-empty shelf, with a cover showing a
  picture of a hunter dressed in clothes made of animal skins and leaning on a
  spear*. I was struck at once 15 by the title: The Eskimos* from Greenland to
  Alaska by Dr Robert Gessain. The book was illustrated with photographs and
  engravings*: I liked the look of it, bought it, then went on my way to the
  beach. By noon, I had finished my new book, the first I had read about the life
  of the little men of the north. Was it the author's praise of their hospitality
  that triggered my longing for adventure, or was it fear of returning to the
  sacred forest? I hardly remember. But when I had finished reading, one word
  began to resonate as inside me until it filled my whole being. That sound, that
  word was Greenland. In that land of ice, at least, there would be no snakes!\\

  C2 & Peer pressure exists across society, affecting people beneficially and adversely.
  In the case of the latter, certain risk factors have been identified that can make
  young people prone to undue, and often unwelcome, influence. When this occurs,
  there are strategies that can be used to handle the problem.
  Peers play an important role in a teenager's life as adolescence is the time
  when the desire to fit in and find acceptance and approval from the group is
  strongest. The need for approval is not bad in itself. It is part of what
  motivates adolescents to take extra care with their appearance, for instance.
  At times however, the desire to either impress or gain acceptance by the group
  becomes excessive, and can result in people choosing to take risks, with
  potentially serious consequences. Similarly, they might engage in behaviour
  that is extremely hurtful, like ridiculing someone with a physical or mental
  disability\\
