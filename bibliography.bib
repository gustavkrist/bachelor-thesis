    abstract = {This article presents a novel approach for readability assessment through sorting. A comparator that judges the relative readability between two texts is generated through machine learning, and a given set of texts is sorted by this comparator. Our proposal is advantageous because it solves the problem of a lack of training data, because the construction of the comparator only requires training data annotated with two reading levels. The proposed method is compared with regression methods and a state-of-the art classification method. Moreover, we present our application, called Terrace, which retrieves texts with readability similar to that of a given input text.},

    abstract = "Automatically predicting the level of second language (L2) learner proficiency is an emerging topic of interest and research based on machine learning approaches to language learning and development. The key to the present paper is the combined use of what we refer to as {`}complexity contours{'}, a series of measurements of indices of L2 proficiency obtained by a computational tool that implements a sliding window technique, and recurrent neural network (RNN) classifiers that adequately capture the sequential information in those contours. We used the EF-Cambridge Open Language Database (Geertzen et al. 2013) with its labelled Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) levels (Council of Europe 2018) to predict six classes of L2 proficiency levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) in the assessment of writing skills. Our experiments demonstrate that an RNN classifier trained on complexity contours achieves higher classification accuracy than one trained on text-average complexity scores. In a secondary experiment, we determined the relative importance of features from four distinct categories through a sensitivity-based pruning technique. Our approach makes an important contribution to the field of automated identification of language proficiency levels, more specifically, to the increasing efforts towards the empirical validation of CEFR levels.",
